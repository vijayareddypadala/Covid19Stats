  SQLALchemy

  Pandas                     
  Matplotlib                   

### Installation Instructions
  First create an virtual environment so that there won't be any effect on the original python libraries if anything goes wrong.
  ###### Eg. python3 -m venv flask_env
  Now Activate the environment by going into the flask_env directory and then to scripts and then run activate.bat
  ###### Eg. flask_env\Scripts\activate
  This activates the virtual environment                                      
  Now Proceed with the installation of requirements
  ##### Note: You Can Copy the requirements to a text file and install them all at a time using pip or install them one by one.

### Running Flask Application
  Make sure you have activated the virtual environment where flask is installed.                             
  Then run the main.py file as you would run the python file.

##### Note: Also Create static folder along with templates folder as the plots will be stored temporarily there.
